;;; Commentary:

;; A tag is a record of an identifier in a source tree.  It could contain
;; information such as what's the name of the identifier, where does it appear,
;; what's the kind of it (function? variable?), etc.  If we compare a source
;; tree to a book, then a tag is an item in its back-of-book index.

;; There are some programs that generate a file or database containing all tags
;; they could find in a source tree.  Ctags creates tags in a plain text file
;; called "tags file".  Gtags creates tags in a set of binary databases, and
;; the "global" program could read it and print them in plain text.  Ctags and
;; gtags both supports multiple languages, but there are also some programs
;; that only support one language, like hasktags, gotags, ripper-tags.  They
;; all create tags files in ctags format.

;; The "tag data structure" defined in this file is an elisp object that models
;; a tag created by such a program.  It is closely modeled after tags in ctags
;; format.  APIs are provided to create/modify a tag and get information from
;; it.

;; A tag, as defined in this file, is a table of field -> value pairs.  The
;; fields are symbols, and a tag can contain arbitrary amount of fields with
;; arbitrary names.  There are no restrictions on the type of values, but since
;; tags are usually get from a tags file (in plain text), or the output of a
;; program (in plain text too), it's suggested to keep values as strings.

;; We do have some specifications on some fields and their values.  They
;; closely follows the Universal Ctags tags file format, see the manpages
;; tags(5) and ctags-client-tools(7), but notice the escape rules in the
;; manpages don't apply: our field values don't contain escape characters,
;; except for some special ones, like the `pattern' field.

;; - `name': The name of the identifier.

;; - `input': The path to the file containing the identifier.  This is
;;   presented in ctags format, but there are no guarantee whether it's
;;   absolute or relative, so use `ext-abspath' instead unless you are
;;   recording a value straight from a tags file.

;; - `pattern': A string that may contain a line number and a search pattern to
;;   locate the tag.  We have APIs to create and parse patterns so you don't
;;   need to care about the actual structure.

;; - `kind': The kind of the tag, like "function", "variable" or
;;   "class"... This is presented in ctags format, but sometimes it uses a
;;   single letter (e.g., "f" for "function"), which is not very readable.  So
;;   use `ext-kind-full' instead unless you are recording a value straight from
;;   a tags file.

;; - `line': The line number containing the identifier.  Should be a string.

;; - `end': If the identifier is in its definition, this is the line number
;;   where the definition ends.  Should be a string.

;; - `extras': Comma separated list of extra properties of the tag, e.g.,
;;   "fileScope,qualified" means it's an identifier that has file scope, and is
;;   qualified (which means the name is prefixed by its namespace).  See "$
;;   ctags --list-extras" to know the properties.

;; - `language': The language around the identifier.  For now Citre doesn't use
;;   this field in a generic way so you could record it as it is from its
;;   source.

;; - `typeref': The type of the identifier.  The value is 2 parts separated by
;;   a colon, like "struct:structName" or "union:unionName".  If a single name
;;   could describe the type, use "typename:name", where "typename" is a
;;   placeholder with no actual meaning.

;; - `scope': The scope which the identifier belongs to.  The value is 2 parts
;;   separated by a colon, like "union:unionName".

;; - `ext-abspath': The absolute path of the file containing the identifier.
;;   When the file is a remote one, this should be a remote file name.

;; - `ext-kind-full': The kind of the tag.  When it's possible to get the
;;   full-length kind (like "function") rather than single-letter kind (like
;;   "f"), this should be the full-length one, otherwise it can be
;;   single-letter.

;; Here's a table of whether a field affects locating & displaying a tag.  See
;; `citre-locate-tag' and `citre-make-tag-str' for details.

;; | field         | locating | displying | remarks |
;; |---------------|----------|-----------|---------|
;; | name          | yes      | yes       |         |
;; | input         |          |           | ^1      |
;; | pattern       | yes      | yes       |         |
;; | kind          |          |           | ^2      |
;; | line          | yes      | yes       |         |
;; | end           |          |           |         |
;; | extras        |          | yes       | ^3      |
;; | language      |          |           |         |
;; | typeref       |          | yes       |         |
;; | scope         |          | yes       |         |
;; | ext-abspath   | yes      | yes       |         |
;; | ext-kind-full |          | yes       |         |

;; ^1: Citre uses `ext-abspath' instead.
;; ^2: Citre uses `ext-kind-full' instead.
;; ^3: Citre only displays whether it's a reference tag (whether the value
;;     contains "reference")

;;;;; Helpers for getting information from a tag

;;;;;; Extended getter

(defun citre-get-tag-field (field tag &optional after-colon)
  "Get FIELD from TAG.
FIELD should be a symbol.  When it is `line' or `end', an integer
is returned, instead of a string.

FIELD could also be:

- `extra-line': The line number of the tag.
- `extra-lang': The language.
- `extra-matched-str': The string encoded by the search pattern in tag.

These are called extra extension fields.  They are not contained
in the tag itself, but calculated in real-time (e.g., when the
tag doesn't have a `line' field, but the `pattern' field records
the line number, `extra-line' gives you that line number).  See
`citre-tag-extra-ext-fields-table' for the details.

AFTER-COLON: if it's non-nil, the field is splitted at the first
colon, and the part after it is returned.  This is for fields
like `scope' or `typeref'.  In a tagline they may look like this:

    typeref:struct:structName

when getting the `typeref' field from this tag, a non-nil
AFTER-COLON gives \"structName\", while nil gives
\"struct:structName\".

If you use this option on a field that doesn't contain a colon,
the whole field is returned."
