;;;;;; The lookup table

(defvar citre-language-support-alist nil
  "The lookup table for language-specific support.

A key of it is the language's major mode (a symbol).

A value of it is a plist.  Its props and values are:

- `:get-symbol': The function to get the symbol at point.

  It's a function with no arguments.  The returned value is a
  string of the symbol name.  To support auto-completion, Citre
  requires a `citre-bounds' property, which is a cons pair of the
  beginning/end positions of the symbol.  You can use other
  properties to record the information you need for
  filtering/sorting the tags, see the props below.

  If you don't specify this prop, `citre-get-symbol-default' is
  used as fallback.  You can also use it internally, and add more
  properties you need.

  When there's an inactive region, it's recommended to get the
  text in it as a symbol, so when your function doesn't work well
  for the user, they can manually specify which part to get.
  `citre-get-marked-symbol' implements this, and is also used by
  `citre-get-symbol'.

- `:completion-filter': The filter for auto-completion.

  It can be a filter expression, a symbol whose value is a filter
  expression, or a function that takes the string returned by the
  `:get-symbol' function, and returns the filter expression.  The
  fallback is `citre-completion-default-filter'.

- `:completion-sorter': The sorter for auto-completion.

  It can be a sorter expression, a symbol whose value is a sorter
  expression, or a function that takes the string returned by the
  `:get-symbol' function, and returns the sorter expression.The
  fallback is `citre-completion-default-sorter'.

- `:definition-filter' and `:definition-sorter': The same as
  `:completion-filter' and `:completion-sorter', but used for
  finding definitions.  Their fallback values are
  `citre-definition-default-filter' and
  `citre-definition-default-sorter'.")
