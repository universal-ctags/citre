;;;; User Options

(defcustom citre-jump-select-item-function
  #'citre-jump-completing-read
  "The function for the user to select an item from a list.
It receives 2 arguments:

- A list of one or more strings representing
  definitions/references.  The function should let the user
  choose one in it.  The list is guaranteed to have one or more
  elements.  When there is only one element, the function can
  decide to let the user confirm, or return it directly.
- A string of the symbol name that's interested in.  The function
  can show it to the user.

See `citre-jump-completing-read' for an example of
implementation."

  "Show TAGS using `citre-jump' UI.
SYMBOL is shown as the prompt.  If it's nil, use the `name' field
in the first tag in TAGS as the symbol.

If MARKER is non-nil, push it into the history so we can go back
to it using `citre-jump-back'.  If it's nil, the marker at point
is used as MARKER.  If it's `none', don't push it to the history.

If ROOT is non-nil, show paths relative to ROOT.  If it's nil,
use `citre-project-root' to deduce the project root and show
paths relative to it.  If it's `none', show absolute paths."
