A `citre-process' instance is returned.

The process is killed when its status changes, so this function
is not suited for process that needs to be
stopped/continued/connected, etc.  The process is assumed to just
run, and then exit or be terminated by a signal.

NAME is the name of the process.  When it's nil, the first
element in CMD is used as the name.  The name may be uniquified.

CALLBACK is called when the output of the process is received, or
when the status of it changed.  It receives 2 arguments: STATUS
and MSG.  STATUS can be:

- output: We've received a chunk from stdout of the process.  MSG
  is this chunk, and is guaranteed to end in a newline char.
- an integer: The process exited with STATUS.  If it's 0, MSG is
  nil; otherwise MSG is the stderr output.
- signal: The process is terminated by a signal.  MSG is nil.
- other status: See `process-status' for details.  This is the
  abnormal case as we assume the process is either running,
  exited or terminated by a signal.

There's no guarantee that `output' status doesn't occur after the
process exits or be terminated as the output is buffered.  Refer
to `citre-get-output-lines' for how to deal with it if it matters
for your callback function."

;; This is a synchronous function, but we use async process in it internally,
;; rather than using the synchronous `call-process', is quitting (pressing
;; `C-g') during `call-process' tries to terminate the process using SIGINT,
;; and only when the process doesn't end immediately, and quitting happens
;; again, it uses SIGKILL.  This may cause lagging for popup completion.
;;
;; The detailed explanation is: The completion UI may wrap this function in
;; `while-no-input' for not blocking the UI, which sends a quit signal when
;; user input arrives, which triggers SIGINT or SIGKILL.  But SIGINT may not
