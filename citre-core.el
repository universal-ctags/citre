   tags file -> hash table of additional info:
                (info field -> value))

Info fields and their corresponding values are:

- `time': The last update time of the file info, which is, the
  hash table.  It's in the style of (current-time).
- `remotep': Whether the tags file is a remote file.
- `dir': The canonical current working directory when generating
  the tags file.  It's a remote dir when tags file is a remote
  file name.
- `os': When the local part of `dir' is unix-style path (begins
  with a slash), this is `unix', or it's `nt'.  We have such a
  field since `system-type' can't tell us about the remote
  machine, and the behavior of many file functions depends on the
  *local* system type.
- `kind-table': A hash table for getting full-length kinds from
  single-letter kinds, like
  `citre-core--kind-name-single-to-full-table', or nil if the
  TAG_KIND_DESCRIPTION pseudo tags are not presented.")

This returns a hash table called \"tag\" by Citre.  Its keys are
the fields, values are their values.  It can be utilized by
`citre-get-field'.

Optional arguments can be used to specify the fields wanted in
the returned tag. REQUIRE, OPTIONAL, EXCLUDE and PARSE-ALL-FIELDS
are similar to `citre-core-get-tags', but extension fields can't
appear in them.  Use these for extension fields:

- REQUIRE-EXT: A list containing extension fields that must be
  presented.  If any of these fields can't be get, an error will
  occur.
- OPTIONAL-EXT: A list containing fields that's optional.  For
  any field in it, if it can be get, it will be recorded; if
  can't, it's ignored, and no error will occur.

The normal fields they depend on should appear in either REQUIRE,
OPTIONAL or EXT-DEP to make sure they are captured.

TAGSFILE-INFO is needed to offer additional information for these
extension fields.  It is the additional info of the tags file
containing LINE.  Such TAGSFILE-INFO should be get using
`citre-core-tags-file-info'.

The arguments must satisfy certain conditions, which the caller
should take care of.  `citre-core--parse-line' doesn't check them
for the sake of performance.  Other than those mentioned above,
we still have:

- All lists specifying needed fields should not contain
  duplicated elements.
- REQUIRE, OPTIONAL and EXCLUDE shouldn't intersect with each
  other.
- EXT-DEP shouldn't intersect with REQUIRE or OPTIONAL.
- OPTIONAL and EXCLUDE should not be used together."

  "Return a sorter expression based on ARGS.
The return value can be used as the :sorter argument in

Each element of FIELDS can be:

- A symbol.  For example, `input' means sort based on the input
  field, in ascending order.

- A list

      (field SYMBOL +/-)

  For example, `(field line +)' means sorting based on the line
  field, in ascending order, and `(field line -)' means in
  descending order.

- A list

  For example, `(length name +)' means sorting based on the
  lengths of the tag names, in ascending order, and `(length name
  -)' means in the descending order.

- A list

  For example, `(filter (eq? $kind \"file\") +)' means puting
  tags with \"file\" kind above others, and `(filter (eq? $kind
  \"file\") -)' means putting them below others.

In readtags, if you sort directly based on a field that's missing
in some lines, it will throw an error.  Here, all above variants
except the \"filter\" one are processed so that this won't
happen, and the order of tags involving missing fields is
uncertain.  For \"filter\" variant, it's recommended to build the
filter expression using Citre APIs to make sure it can be evaled
on each tag.  You can think that tags that are keeped by
`citre-core-filter' are put above/below others.

When multiple elements are presented in FIELDS, they are tried in

  "Get tags in TAGSFILE.
TAGSFILE is the absolute path of tags file.  The meaning of the
optional arguments are:

- NAME: Should be a string or nil.  If this is a non-empty
  string, filter the tags matching NAME before FILTER does its
  job.  Otherwise they are only filtered by FILTER.

- MATCH: How to match the tag name by NAME.  Can be:

  - Nil or `exact': Match tags whose name is NAME.
  - `prefix': Match tags that start with NAME.
  - `suffix': Match tags that ends with NAME.
  - `substr': Match tags that contains NAME.
  - `regexp': Match tags that match the regexp NAME.

  Nil, `exact' and `prefix' are done by the NAME action in
  readtags, others are done by the filter expression.

- CASE-FOLD: Nil means performing case-insensitive matching,
  non-nil means performing case-sensitive matching.

Filter and sorter expressions can be specified by these keyword
arguments:

- FILTER: Should be nil, or a postprocessor expression.  Non-nil
  means filtering the tags with it using -Q option.
- SORTER: Should be nil, or a postprocessor expression.  Non-nil
  means sortering the tags with it using -S option.

Requirements of postprocessor expressions are:

- Should be a symbol, or a list containing
  symbols/strings/similar lists.
- Use strings for strings, symbols for
  operators/variables/anything else.
- Use `true' for `#t', `false' for `#f', and nil or `()'
  for `()'.
- Use `(string->regexp \"PATTERN\")' or `(string->regexp
  \"PATTERN\" :case-fold true)' for `#/PATTERN/' or
  `#/PATTERN/i'.

Each element in the returned value is a hash table containing the
fields of matched tags, which can be utilized by
`citre-core-get-field'.  The fields to contain can be customized
by these keyword arguments:

- REQUIRE: A list containing fields that must be presented.  If
  any of these fields doesn't exist, an error will occur.
- OPTIONAL: A list containing fields that's optional.  For any
  field in it, if it's presented in a tagline, it will be
  recorded; if not presented, it's ignored, and no error will
  occur.
- EXCLUDE: A list containing fields that should be excluded.  All
  other fields will be recorded.

OPTIONAL and EXCLUDE should not be used together.  When both
OPTIONAL and EXCLUDE are not presented, then only the fields in
REQUIRE are parsed, unless PARSE-ALL-FIELDS is non-nil.

Fields should be symbols.  Please notice these field names:

- `name': The name of the tag itself.
- `input': The file containing the tag.
- `pattern': EX command used to search the tag in the file.

If the tags file is not generated with --fields=+Z, then a
`scope' field like \"scope:class:A\" becomes \"class:A\".  If
this happens, there's no reliable way to know such a field is
actually a `scope' field.  Currently, when the scope is class or
struct, Citre parses them correctly.  Otherwise the scope name is
used as the field name.

Certain fields may offer ambiguous information.  To ascertain
them, Citre offers its own extension fields:

- `ext-abspath': The canonical path of `input'.

  Needs `input' field to be presented in the tags file.  When the
  tags file is a remote file, this is also a remote file name.

- `ext-kind-full': The full name of `kind'. It uses the `kind'
  field if it's not single-letter, or it guesses the full name by
  `kind' and the language (which is also guessed by `input' if
  necessary).

  Needs `kind', `language' or `input' fields to be presented in
  the tags file.

  When this fails, the single-letter kind is used.

For more on extension fields, see
`citre-core--ext-fields-dependency-alist' and
`citre-core--ext-fields-method-table'.  To use an extension
field, it must appear in REQUIRE or OPTIONAL."

  "Get FIELD from TAG.
TAG is an element in the return value of `citre-core-get-tags'.
FIELD can be all normal and extension fields.

When FIELD is `line' or `end', an integer is returned, instead of
a string.

When AFTER-COLON is non-nil, the field is splitted at the first
colon, and the part after it is returned.  This is for fields
like `scope' or `typeref'.  In a tagline they may look like this:

    typeref:struct:structName

when getting the `typeref' field from this tag, a non-nil
AFTER-COLON gives \"structName\", while nil gives
\"struct:structName\".

If you use this option on a field that doesn't contain a colon,
the whole field is returned.

`citre-core-extra-ext-fields-table' defines some extra fields
that can be used as FIELD.  Their values are calculated in
real-time based on TAG.  The built-in ones are:

- `extra-line': The line number of the tag.  This uses the `line'
  field directly, and if it's not presented, get the line number
  from the pattern field if it's recorded there.  If both can't
  be done, return nil.

- `extra-lang': The language.  It uses the `language' field if
  it's presented, or guesses the language by the file extension.
  When both fails, the file extension (or the file name, if it
  doesn't have an extension) is returned.

- `extra-matched-str': The substring in the source file that's
  matched by ctags when generating the tag.  It's often the whole
  line containing the tag.  This depends on the `pattern' field,
  and returns nil if it doesn't record the matched string (e.g.,
  in tags file generated using the -n option)."
