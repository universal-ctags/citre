# User option

-  An user option for case sensitivity.

   We want "smart case fold", i.e. when doing prefix/substring match, if the
   input chars are all downcase, do case insensitive search, otherwise do case
   sensitive search.

   We should offer an user option (`citre-smart-case-fold`) to choose from
   "smart case fold" (`t`) and "always case sensitive" (`nil`).

   When doing "exact match", we should always do case sensitive search.

- An user option for enabling different features.

  We should have a set of local variables to let the user decide which features
  to enable.

- Tags generation recipe system

  Through such system, people can specify target name, target path (`nil` means
  use output of ctags directly), ctags command (`nil` means use the command
  built by Citre), which directories will make use of them (`nil` means the
  whole project), and when should it be automatically updated (this is a list
  of directories, when files in these dirs are saved, the tags file is
  updated. `nil` means always, and `'no` means don't).

  Ideally, we should do incremental update. I've seen some vim plugins that can
  do this (so we must do better!). The basic idea is when saving, remove those
  lines in the tags file that belongs to this file, than only scan this file
  and use the "append" option to update. But here's a trap: when using
  something like wgrep, we may save a lot of files at a time. We should use
  some kind of lock to make this safe. Another thing is we need to modify the
  command specified by the user to change the input files, and the command may
  use a configuration file, then it's impossible to modify. Let's see if feed
  files from stdin can override this. Or at least we can ask the user not to
  specify input files in the command, and write them to the recipe instead.

  We should design the system so configuring it for a simple project is easy,
  at the same time it can serve for any large projects.

# Functionality

- Eldoc integration

  Now I only have a vague idea. Maybe we can assume in non-lisp languages, we
  call callable symbols like `symbol(arg1, arg2)` (notice the arg themselves
  can also be in this form). We can parse backward from point, and see if the
  symbol before `(` has `font-lock-function-name-face`. If so, we fetch the
  "signature" field of it and show it.

- Auto completion for "dot patterns"

  We should come up with our own "symbol-at-point" function. By calling it we
  get the symbol at point, and if the chars before it are ".", "->" or "::",
  the symbol before these things. Then we can make use of "typeref" and "scope"
  fields to get better completion results.

  I can think of completing struct members now, but I want to support more "dot
  patterns". I need to think of all (at least most of) the possibilities and
  figure out what are those can be solved based on tags file.

- Sort

  We should come up with our own sort function, and not rely on the sorting of
  ctags. We want a sort algorithm just like prescient.el, plus when required,
  put the candidates with certain field contents before others.

- A new jump to definition interface

  Now we already have many flavors of "jump to definition":

  - When you are coding and want to quickly see the docstring/definition of the
    function: use `citre-peek`.
  - When you want to read the definition in depth or modify it: xref or
    `citre-jump`. What's neat about `citre-jump` is you can jump when you are
    peeking.

  But we still need to come up with an interface for people who read complex
  source code for hours. I haven't noticed this requirement before, but there
  are people who need this. Let's see what will Mr. Yamato will say about this.

- Jump to definition from a dependency that's not in the root of current

  Maybe this is not worth it, but it's nice in some situations. We need to
  modify the project root detection method. If we can't detect the root, but
  it's a dependency of an opening project (just check through recipes in
  `citre--project-info-alist`), then set the root to be that project's root.
  Then, after `citre-jump`, enable Citre mode, then the project root is set,
  and we need to somehow know which are the targets it use (again, let the user
  specify the input files for each target can be handy). If this can be done,
  everything should work like usual.

  Let me rethink this. We want to make sure these things works after jumping to
  a definition that's not in the project root:

  - If itself is a configured project, then everything should works. We can
    confirm this by detecting tags file / tags generation recipe. Notice that
    for the code map, they should still be treated as in the project we jump
    from, or the history will lost. We can do this by a buffer-local
    `citre--map-project-root` variable.

  - If it isn't a configured project, then at least jumping to definition
    should works so we can go really deep. My thought is just set its root to
    the project we come from. This should work and the reason is long:

    In future ctags will have the ability to automatically analyse the imported
    modules in a file, so we'll have an `citre-common-dependency-alist` whose
    keys are languages (maybe major modes, or file extensions), and values are
    typical dependency/site-package directories of popular package
    manager/virtualenvs. We can also explicitely specify the dependency
    directories for a project. When using Citre, it will scan the current file,
    find the tags in the tags file, and if there are still modules that's not
    covered, find in dependency dirs (maybe an option for users who only wants
    to use the tags file and not do further search). Now when we are in a file
    that belongs to a project, but not in its root, we can do basically the
    same thing, maybe get rid of the relative paths in
    `citre-common-dependency-alist` and the specified dependencies since they
    are for things in the project root.

# API

- Rework the APIs so we can use readtags to do filtering based on any fields.

  I'm not sure if we want to only keep tags with certain field values, or put
  them before others (using the sort algorithm above). Since we actually don't
  know the AST, there's chance we guessed the completely wrong type of "dot
  pattern" and give the wrong results. So I think it's better to keep other
  tags as well.

  readtags can't read tags from stdin, one way I found is to use named pipe, it
  functions like a file but is a pipe. Bash and some other shells can do
  "process substitution", like this:

  ```console
  $ readtags -t <(ctags -R -f-) -l
  ```

  This is really neat, but not POSIX compatible. For POSIX compatible solution,
  we can create a named pipe with a unique name first, and use it:

  ```console
  $ tmp=$(mktemp -u citre-temp-XXXX --tmpdir)
  # I don't know why I can't write ctags output directly to this named pipe
  # here. I have to redirect to it.
  $ mkfifo $tmp && (ctags -R -f- > $tmp &) && readtags -t $tmp -l && rm $tmp
  ... readtags output ...
  ```

  We could put them in one line, and that's pretty much a poor man's process
  substitution.

# Misc

  - See where do the dependencies live in popular package/virtualenv managers,
    and put them in the excluded patterns for large projects.

  - put "*Test", "*_test" and "*-test" in excluded patterns. I need to see what
    are the usual names.

  - Add more faces.

  - When calling `citre-jump` without symbol at point, ask for user input to
    search for symbols.

  - Signal an error when the needed fields are not presented.

    We need to think carefully about this. Technically we only need the tag
    itself for completion, and line number for various jumping commands. But
    it's in the plan to make Citre give more accurate results based on various
    informations, and we want to make use of the readtags program. It's better
    to design this behavior after these changes. We need to figure out:

   - Which are the fields needed for every user commands. Citre should fail
     when the command is called, and the needed fields are not presented. I
     think it's safe to assume a user would use both completion and jumping
     functionalities, so Citre should fail while parsing, to make sure all
     necessary fields are presented.

   - Which are the fields that gives better experience/UI. We should put these
     in the manual.

  - Since in the future we'll know and scan imported modules for current file,
    the "project size" thing doesn't really matter. We'll get rid of it. Then
    `citre-mode` is not really necessary too, it has two uses:

    - Set up the hooks/functions to offer integration with Emacs built-in
      mechanisms.
    - Write project information, including the size.

    We require `citre-mode` to be enabled when using interactive commands,
    because calculating the size may take a while. But in the future we could
    create a procedure to write project information if it's not presented (it
    will be fast since we don't need the size), then use it in all the
    interactive commands, so they can be used when `citre-mode` is not enabled.

    The keybindings in citre-peek is based on overriding the keybindings of
    `citre-mode`. We should create its own minor mode and handle keybindings
    using it.

    And now there are 3 things that needs citre-mode: capf, xref, eldoc. For
    the first two, we could create our own `citre-xref-find-definition` and
    `citre-completion-at-point` functions, they let bind the necessary
    variables and call xref/capf commands. In this way we could use all the
    functionalities except eldoc integration without citre-mode. But maybe we
    are going too far. If the user want this, they could wrap their own
    commands.

  - Some sequences (like tabs) are escaped in tags file. We need to figure out
    how this is exactly down, and maybe do appropriate unescaping when parsing.
    I believe they are mostly handled in the output of readtags, but we need to
    confirm.

# Selectrum integration

We want selectrum versions of these commands:

- `citre-jump-command`
- `citre-completion-in-region-function`
