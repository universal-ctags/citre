as the symbol at point when there's an active region, so the user
could specify the symbol in case it's not grabbed correctly.

point, xref prompts the user for an identifier.  If the backend
wants to support this, IDENTIFIER-LIST-FUNC and
GET-DEFINITIONS-FOR-ID-FUNC are needed.

IDENTIFIER-LIST-FUNC is called with no arguments and inside the

identifiers in the current project.  If no identifier is
