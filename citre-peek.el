;;;; Internals

;;;;; Data structures

;; These are data structures that handles code reading history in citre-peek.
;; Let's have a brief description of the basic concepts first:

;; When you peek a symbol, you create a *def list* ("def" stands for
;; "definition") of its definition locations.  Each element in a def list is
;; called a *def entry*, which has 2 important slots: one for the tag of that
;; definition, and another is a list called *branches*, which we'll soon
;; explain.

;; In a peek session, you are always browsing a def entry.  When you peek
;; through a symbol, a new def list is created.  To keep a complete history of
;; your code reading session, this def list is pushed into the branches of the
;; current browsed def entry.

;; The history of a peek session is a tree like this:

;; - def list
;;   - def entry 1
;;     - def list A
;;     - def list B
;;   - def entry 2
;;     - def list C
;;   - def entry 3
;;   ...

;;;;; State variables

;; NOTE: Here's a list of when should each state variable be changed.  Keep
;; these in mind when you are developing citre-peek related commands.

;; - `citre-peek--session-root-list': Set this only for a new peek session.
;;
;; - `citre-peek--depth-in-root-list': Set this to 1 for a new peek session,
;;   and modify it when moving forward/backward in the chain (including peeking
;;   through).  Make sure it's >= 0 and <= maximum possible depth.
;;
;; - `citre-peek--displayed-defs-interval': Set this for a new peek session,
;;   and when browsing the def list, and when moving in the chain.
;;
;; - `citre-peek--temp-buffer-alist': Set this when doing ace jump (peeking
;;   through for now), and clean it up after a succeeded/canceled jump.
;;
;; - `citre-peek--symbol-bounds', `citre-peek--ace-seqs': Set these when
;;   peeking through, and clean it up after
;;
;; - `citre-peek--ov', `citre-peek--bg'(-alt, -selected): You shouldn't use
;;   them directly.  These are controlled by `citre-peek--mode', and it makes
;;   sure that the overlay is cleaned up correctly.  When other state variables
;;   are set up, enable `citre-peek-mode' sets up the UI, and disable
;;   `citre-peek--mode' hides the UI.
